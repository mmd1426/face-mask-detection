# Face Mask Detection

## Introduction

This project aims to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The model is trained to classify images into two categories: wearing a mask and not wearing a mask. The objective is to provide an accurate and reliable solution for real-time face mask detection.

## Features

- **Deep Learning-Based Model**: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate classification.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Can be integrated into surveillance systems for monitoring mask compliance.
- **Dataset from Open Sources**: Trained on publicly available datasets containing labeled face images with and without masks.
- **Preprocessing and Augmentation**: Includes essential image preprocessing techniques and data augmentation for improved model performance.

## Model

- A CNN-based deep learning model is used for classification.
- Transfer learning technique using **VGG16** is applied to enhance accuracy.
